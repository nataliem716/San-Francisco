        <p class="new">San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a commercial and cultural center in Northern California.<br> The city proper is the 17th most populous in the United States, and the fourth most populous in California, with 815,201 
             residents as of 2021. The sights, sports, music, and cultural attractions alone inspire millions of travelers each year. However, the biggest draw is San Francisco's renowned culinary landscape. Food and drink are intricately woven into the region's history and traditions, making the Bay Area a dining destination like no other. The city is chock-full of charming sidewalk cafes, stunning city parks, miles of hiking trails, breathtaking viewpoints, and some of the best restaurants the county has to offer, moving to San Francisco was an easy choice. The culture of San Francisco is major and diverse in terms of arts, music, cuisine, festivals, museums, and architecture but also is influenced heavily by Mexican culture due to its large Hispanic population, and its history as part of Spanish America and Mexico.</p>

            <p class="new"> Coit Tower is a 210-foot tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California, offering panoramic views over the city and the bay. The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was built between 1932 and 1933 using Lillie Hitchcock Coit's bequest to beautify the city of San Francisco. Coit Tower is named for Lillie Hitchcock Coit, an early San Francisco philanthropist and adorer of local firefighters. In addition to her love of San Francisco and firefighting, Coit was noted for sometimes dressing like a man and pursuing what were considered masculine pastimesâ€”like gambling and sharpshooting</p>
